  summary: Systematic comparison of trip distribution laws and models
  description: |
    The main purpose of the TDLM package is to provide a rigorous framework for fairly comparing trip distribution laws and models, as described in Lenormand et al. (2016). This general framework relies on a two-step approach to generate mobility flows, separating the trip distribution law, gravity or intervening opportunities, from the modeling approach used to derive flows from this law.
